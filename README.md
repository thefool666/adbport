# 🔧 adb-auto-enable

**Automatically enable wireless ADB debugging and switch to your chosen port (default 5555) on every boot, no root required!**

Android 14 introduces enhanced ADB security which disables and randomises the port used after sleep/reboot, breaking automation setups. Auto ADB Enable automatically re-enables wireless ADB, maintaining remote access for non-interactive devices.

> [!WARNING]
> **SECURITY WARNING:** This application enables Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your configured port (default 5555), which provides remote access to your device with full system privileges. While ADB connections require RSA key authentication (users must accept the connection on first pairing), **once a computer is authorized, it has permanent unrestricted access** to install applications, access all data, execute shell commands, and take complete control of your device without further prompts. Additionally, the RSA authentication prompt is vulnerable to overlay attacks where malicious apps can trick users into authorizing connections. **This app should ONLY be used on isolated or trusted networks** (such as a home network behind a firewall with no port forwarding) and **NEVER on public WiFi, guest networks, or any network you do not fully control**. Exposing ADB to the internet or untrusted networks can result in complete device compromise if an attacker gains authorization, either through social engineering, overlay attacks, or physical access to previously paired computers. Use this tool only on devices you own and ensure your network is properly secured with a firewall blocking external access.

## Quick Start

### Requirements:

- Android 14+ (tested on Chromecast with Google TV and modern Android builds)
- Wi-Fi connection
### 1. Installation

Download and install the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/mouldybread/adb-auto-enable/releases), or build from source:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mouldybread/adb-auto-enable.git](https://github.com/mouldybread/adb-auto-enable.git)
cd adb-auto-enable
./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **First-Time Installation Note:** After installing the APK, you **must open the app on your device once** (via *Settings → Apps → See All Apps → ADB Auto-Enable*) to start the background web server before you can access `http://your-device-ip:9093`.

### 2. Initial Pairing

1. Navigate to `http://your-device-ip:9093` in a browser.
2. On your Android device:
   - Go to **Settings → Developer Options → Wireless Debugging**
   - Tap **"Pair device with pairing code"**
3. Keep the "Pair device with pairing code" screen open on your device. Enter the **pairing code** and **pairing port** into the web interface.
4. Click **"Pair Device"**.

### 3. Verify Setup

1. (Optional) Click **"Switch Target Port Now"** in the web interface to test the configuration manually.
2. (Optional) Wait 30 seconds and check status — should show "✓ Available".
3. Reboot your device and wait 30-60 seconds (service initialization + 30s system stabilization delay), then connect to your configured port:

```bash
adb connect your-device-ip:5555
```

## Troubleshooting
### Pairing fails
If pairing fails please open an issue and include your device, version, logs from the web-based gui and/or ADB logs:
```
adb logcat "adbd:V ADBAutoEnable:V *:S"
```

### Boot Configuration Not Running

Check logs in the web UI at `http://device-ip:9093` or via ADB:

```bash
adb logcat "adbd:V ADBAutoEnable:V *:S"
```

Look for:
- `"Boot event detected, starting ADB configuration service immediately..."`
- `"Step 0: Immediately enabling wireless debugging setting..."`
- `"Waiting for WiFi connection..."`
- `"Successfully configured ADB on port 5555!"`



### Web Server Not Accessible

The web server runs on port 9093 in a foreground service. If you can't access it:

1. Check that the service is running:
   ```bash
   adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep AdbConfigService
   ```
2. Verify the device IP address on the main app screen.
3. Ensure you are accessing from the same network subnet: `http://device-ip:9093`.

##  How It Works

1. **One-Time Pairing**: App pairs with itself via localhost, storing authentication keys.
2. **Auto-Grant Permission**: After pairing, the app automatically grants itself `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission via local ADB.
3. **Boot Activation**: On device boot, `BootReceiver` instantly launches `AdbConfigService` to satisfy Android 14+ foreground service launch rules.
4. **Early Setting Enforcement**: Writes `adb_wifi_enabled = 1` to `Settings.Global` before any network or sleep delays.
5. **Stabilization & Network Wait**: Service waits for an active Wi-Fi/Ethernet IP and allows a 30-second system stabilization period.
6. **Port Discovery**: Discovers the randomized ADB port using mDNS or a 64-thread parallel socket sweep (`32768–60999`).
7. **Self-Connection & Switch**: Connects to the local ADB daemon (127.0.0.1 loopback -> device LAN IP fallback) and sends the tcpip:<target_port> command.
8. **Done!**: ADB is available on your target port for external connections!

Authentication keys are generated locally and stored in `/data/data/com.tpn.adbautoenable/files/`.

### Boot Process Flow

```text
LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED / BOOT_COMPLETED → BootReceiver
  ↓
Start AdbConfigService Foreground Service (Immediate)
  ↓
Start Web Server (port 9093)
  ↓
Step 0: Write adb_wifi_enabled = 1 immediately
  ↓
Step 1: Wait for WiFi connection (up to 60s)
  ↓
Step 2: Wait for system stabilization (30s)
  ↓
Step 3: Discover randomized ADB port (mDNS → 64-thread socket sweep fallback)
  ↓
Step 4: Connect to ADB daemon (127.0.0.1 loopback → Device LAN IP fallback)
  ↓
Send tcpip:<target_port> command
  ↓
Success! (with 3 retry attempts if needed)
```
